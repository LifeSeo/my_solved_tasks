15 Best Deer-Resistant Plants and Flowers - Deer Repellent Plants
You can also discourage deer by not planting their favorites such as hostas, daylilies, azaleas, and arborvitae. When shopping, read the plant tag so you know how much sun or shade a plant needs. (Full sun is considered 6 or more hours of direct sunlight, while part sun is about half that.)

How to Keep Deer from Eating Plants and Out of Your Yard
The most effective technique for deterring deer is a fence around the garden. A fence to keep deer out should extend partly underground and not have gaps bigger than 6x6 inches where deer can squeeze through or crawl under to get into your yard. Enclose the entire garden, or they'll go around the fence. A fence should also be at least 8 feet high.
