A very informal - almost childish - way of asking how are you in Russian is to say: –∫–∞–∫ - how –¥–µ–ª–∏—à–∫–∏ - things (a diminutive form of –¥–µ–ª–∞) In Russian, you can make words smaller, by playing around with the ending. There's no hard rule here, and you can sometimes even create new words.
